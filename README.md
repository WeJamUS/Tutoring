# Public Repository for My Tutoring Website
This website is deployed on Heroku at this link (will not be up at all times since I'm currently using a free Heroku monthly plan):
    https://blooming-wildwood-89768.herokuapp.com/
 
External Resources:
  - Zoom API to programmatically create scheduled meetings
  - SmtpJS to email meeting links to students
  - Heroku to host website
  - Integrated Heroku Postgresql database to store all data

The backend code is omitted since it contains sensitive information.
